# Benjamin Pondville - Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! As a passionate **Frontend Developer** with 4 years of experience, I specialize in crafting intuitive and responsive user interfaces using modern web technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. My journey in frontend development has honed my ability to build seamless user experiences that are both visually appealing and functionally robust.

Driven by a desire to broaden my technical skill set and tackle more complex challenges, I am now transitioning into a **Fullstack Developer** role. Currently expanding my knowledge of backend technologies, my goal is to master the entire spectrum of web development, empowering me to design, build, and maintain complete applications from start to finish.

I'm excited to apply my growing expertise in new and innovative projects, and I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals who share a passion for technology and continuous learning. Explore this repository to see examples of my work and the progress of my full-stack journey!
